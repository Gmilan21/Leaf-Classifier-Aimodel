# Leaf-Classifier
This project, "AI Leaf Classifier," is designed to identify various types of leaves from images using a deep learning model. It employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify leaf images into predefined categories based on their species. The primary goal of this project is to develop an easy-to-use web application that leverages machine learning to provide accurate and immediate leaf classification. Users can upload an image of a leaf, and the system will predict its species

Technologies Used Python: For backend development including machine learning model integration. PyTorch: Employed for constructing and training the convolutional neural network. Flask: Used to create the web application serving the model. PIL (Python Imaging Library): Manages image file processing in the backend. HTML/CSS: For developing the frontend interface of the web application.
